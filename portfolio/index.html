                For the index project, I focused on building the main homepage of my website, providing visitors with a welcoming and informative first impression. This page serves as an introduction to my site, where users can learn more about its content and navigate to other sections.

                One of the key additions to this page was the table of learners, where I showcased information about individuals, including their names, ages, and countries. I wanted to make this section informative and easy to read, so I used a table to present the data in a structured manner. This involved creating a table with a header for labels like "Name", "Age", and "Country", followed by a list of learners.
